# Etsy Clone

A simple web application project following the cloud native approach, and
helping me learn DevOps and modern architectures comprehensively.

- Microservices pattern
- Communication using REST and Kafka for low coupling
- Docker Compose for bringing up and down service containers for testing
in dev
- K8s (Minikube) for deploying the final application
- Prometheus, Loki and Grafana for monitoring and log aggregation
- Github Actions for CI/CD
- API Gateway using [TBD]
- Nginx for serving frontend
